    Youth at the Helm: Redefining Urban Governance for a Sustainable Future

As cities are confronting increasing pressures of climate change, migration, and economic inequality, youth participation in urban governance has become a force for transformation towards sustainability and resilience. This research investigates the changing role of youth in influencing urban policy and innovation in the chosen cities of the Asia-Pacific region. The research question is: How can youth decision-making and action help build self-sustaining and future-proof cities?

Using a mixed-methods approach, the research utilizes policy analysis, stakeholder interviews, and case studies in India, Indonesia, and South Korea. It raises to the surface exemplary models including participatory budgeting in Seoul, youth climate councils in Jakarta, and student-initiated urban greening in Agra. The research shows that if institutional arrangements enable youth leadership—through civic platforms, digital platforms, and mentorship—then the impact on local sustainability and innovation is significant.

But the research also highlights areas of exclusion, resource allocation, and intergenerational communication that tend to constrain the extent of youth engagement. Drawing from the research, there is a suggested framework for the incorporation of youth leadership into current urban governance frameworks through collaborative governance systems, education policy linkages, and community-based innovation centers.

In line with the theme of the 10th UCLG ASPAC Congress, this abstract contends that engaging youth is not on the periphery, but at the center of making Sustainable Global Self-Sufficient Cities and Regions a reality. The results provide practical suggestions to city mayors and policymakers on how to institutionalize youth voices in urban development such that cities construct as inclusive, resilient ecosystems co-designed by the very generation that will own them.
